#Breaking Bad Text
Takes a string input and converts it to a Breaking Bad style output, replacing characters with their equivalent periodic table element names. Currently it favors the longest replacement it can do for the word, and only does one replacement for word. It also omits capitalized characters by design to preserve capitalization of formal names, which this is kind of aimed at.
